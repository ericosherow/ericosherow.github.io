        <h1> John's desires </h1>
        Currently, John cannot successfully play the games he desires. 
        <br> John wants to play video games comfortably for periods of up to 1 hour of playtime. 
        <br> John wishes to play games that require a user to be highly dexterous. These games include first-person shooters.  
        <h3> This project must develop a joystick that will allow John to play both effectively and comfortably.

        To begin the process of designing possible solutions for John, the project conducted extensive user evaluations to guage John's abilities. 
        <br> Analyzed by video and interview, the project focused on comparing John's feedback with various types of joysticks. 
        <br> It was extremely important for the the team to thoroughly understand John's abilities. 
        <br> With the project becoming ever more aware of John's behaviour, the team felt better prepared to address John's needs. 
        <h3> Inevitably, the team deduced that the project's primary goal was to ensure John's comfort.

        John's range of movement prohibits him from establishing proper 
        <br> grip, control, and reliability with conventional joysticks.
        <br> This prohibits John from playing the video games he wants desires.
        <br> Our alternative must provide similar inputs to two joysticks, 
        <br> be able to be controlled by Ryan for up to one hour, 
        <br> and be able to be used in conjunction with the button alternatives. 
        <h3> Most importantly, this project must accomplish John's chief desire: to have fun </h3>

    <h1> Refining and Building the Design</h1>
    After Conducting user testing and design evaluations,
    <br> the team settled on a design that satisifed our user's needs.

    <h1>The Effect of Covid-19</h1>
    <h3>Unfortunately, the design could not be physically built and tested. The project presents a highly detailed CAD model instead. 
    <br> While this prevented the project from re-testing the design, 
    <br> based on our feedback from John, the project presents an effective joystick replacement.
